#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I would interpret user needs as a requirement to add value to the clients product. User stories are used to collect the users vision to establish an end goal for developing software. User stories are a great way to implement the user needs to a project. 


#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing a program there are many variables to consider. The biggest deciding factor to me is the level of uncertainty. The higher the level of uncertainty the more scrum agile approach I would take. The planning up-front is not as grueling, creating a product backlog of user stories is key to collect the clients vision, breaking the project into sprints will help have deliverables consistently show progress. Following with sprint reviews anf retrospective will allow for reanalyzing and optimization.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development would follow the scrum values. Commitment is key in an agile culture it will help build trust through out the team. Courage is important on a team because it takes courage to stand up to your team memeber when either something needs to be said or fixed and when you need to ask your team members for help. Focus is needed to be a good team member because when working with a team you are accountable for your work and your focus is needed to ensure all goals are met on time. Openness to me is the most important. People can not read each other minds so being open and true to yourself is key for success in any team setting. Respect should be a given. Respect is not just for being a good team member in software developent but respect is how all are supposed to be treated when encountering anyone. It shows that level of understanding and strengthens the collaboration of the team.
